I can't generate files directly, but you can create your own README.md file by following these steps:  

### Steps to Create & Download `README.md`  
1. Open a text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, or any code editor).  
2. Copy and paste the following content into the file.  
3. Save the file as `README.md` in your project directory.

### 📜 README.md Content  

```markdown
# 🖼️ Image Steganography using Python  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements image steganography, a technique for hiding secret messages within an image by modifying pixel values. The message is securely embedded in the image and can only be retrieved using the correct password. This ensures confidential communication while keeping the data invisible to unauthorized users.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✔ Password-Protected Decryption – Only authorized users can extract hidden messages.  
✔ Minimal Image Distortion – Keeps the image visually unchanged.  
✔ PNG Format for Lossless Encoding – Prevents data loss due to compression.  
✔ Secure and Efficient – No additional storage files required.  
✔ Cross-Platform Compatibility – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python – Core programming language  
- OpenCV (`cv2`) – Image processing  
- NumPy – Pixel manipulation  
- OS Module – To open encrypted images automatically  
- File Handling – Stores metadata (password, message length)

## 📥 Installation & Setup  
### 1️⃣ Prerequisites  
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-steganography.git
cd image-steganography
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Encryption Script  
```bash
python encrypt.py
```
- Enter your secret message and password when prompted.  
- The encrypted image (`encryptedImage.png`) will be saved.  

### 4️⃣ Run the Decryption Script  
```bash
python decrypt.py
```
- Enter the correct password to retrieve the hidden message.  

---

## 👨‍💻 Usage  
1. Run `encrypt.py` to hide a message inside an image.  
2. Share the encrypted image securely.  
3. The recipient runs `decrypt.py` and enters the correct password to extract the hidden message.

## 📌 Conclusion  
This project provides a secure, efficient, and undetectable method for hiding messages inside images. By combining image processing and cryptography, it ensures confidentiality and integrity of the hidden data. It can be further enhanced to support larger messages, different encryption techniques, or file-based hiding.
